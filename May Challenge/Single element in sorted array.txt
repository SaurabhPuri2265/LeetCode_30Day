You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find this single element that appears only once.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10


class Solution {
    public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        
        //Applying XOR as a^0=a,a^a=0
        
        int a=0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++)
            a=a^nums[i];
        
        return a;
    }
}
