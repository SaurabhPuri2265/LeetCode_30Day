Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        
        //Find Number of bits
        int bits=(int)(Math.floor(Math.log(num) / 
                             Math.log(2))) + 1; 
        
        //xor with 2^bits with num
        return ((1<<bits)-1)^num;
        
    }
}
